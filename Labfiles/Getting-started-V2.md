# Migrate Linux Servers to Azure

### Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

In this lab, you will access Hyper-V Manager to start and connect to a Red Hat VM hosting an OSS database, preparing it for migration to Azure using Azure Migrate. You will register your Hyper-V host (LabVM) with the Migration and Modernization service, which leverages Azure Site Recovery as the migration engine. As part of this process, you will deploy the Azure Site Recovery Provider on your Hyper-V host and configure replication of the on-premises VM to Azure Migrate Server Migration. You will then modify the replicated VM settings to assign a static private IP matching the on-premises configuration before executing the migration of the Red Hat VM to Azure. yogesh

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- **Migrating your apps and your data, leveraging Microsoft services and tools like Azure Migrate, the Azure Hybrid Benefit, and other tools and programs**: Perform the migration of a Red Hat VM from Hyper-V to Azure using Azure Migrate and Azure Site Recovery.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- Basic knowledge of Hyper-V Manager and virtual machine management.
- Experience with Red Hat Linux administration and command-line operations.
- Understanding of Azure Migrate and its migration process.
- Familiarity with Azure Site Recovery as a migration engine.
- Ability to configure virtual machine networking, including setting static IP addresses.
  
## Architecture

The architecture flow begins with accessing Hyper-V Manager to start and connect to a Red Hat VM hosting an OSS database. The Hyper-V host (LabVM) is then registered with the Azure Migration and Modernization service, which utilizes Azure Site Recovery as the migration engine. As part of this setup, the Azure Site Recovery Provider is deployed on the Hyper-V host to facilitate replication. The on-premises VM is then configured for replication to the Azure Migrate Server Migration service. Before migration, the replicated VM settings are adjusted to use a static private IP matching its on-premises configuration. Finally, the migration process is executed, transferring the Red Hat VM from Hyper-V to Azure.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Azure Migrate** – A Microsoft service that helps assess, replicate, and migrate on-premises workloads to Azure.
1. **Linux Server** – An open-source operating system that runs applications and services, commonly used for cloud and enterprise workloads.
1. **Hyper-V** – A Microsoft virtualization platform that allows running multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical server.
1. **Red Hat** – A leading enterprise Linux distribution providing security, stability, and performance for cloud and on-prem workloads.
1. **Azure Virtual Networks** – A logically isolated network in Azure that enables secure communication between Azure resources, on-premises networks, and the internet.
